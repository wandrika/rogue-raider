Many thanks to the Jade developers! You saved me a lot of effort, guys!

This game does not do much yet. After running Rogue.class, a random room is generated with a player and one monster. After killing the monster, another one appears somewhere else. It is only to test game mechanisms like basic movement, monster generating, combat, health bar, hitpoints, messages, etc. I plan to implement more advanced movements, combat modes, items like levers, switches, artifacts, and then the overall composition of the game.

Update 27.10.2014: added light sources.
